## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### What I learned

I learned that you don't need to over engineer everything:

did my best to get [this](https://hassaneljebyly.github.io/age-calculator-app/counter.html) to work, but the code got so big and there was tons of bugs, got annoyed, I will give it another shot after I clear my head.
